## ðŸ§µ Unity Cloth Simulation â€“ In Progress

This is a custom cloth simulation built in Unity as part of my technical portfolio. The goal is to develop a system that reacts to forces (like wind and gravity), anchors, and collisions, using code-driven physics rather than relying solely on Unityâ€™s built-in cloth component.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Engine**: Unity (C#)
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Goal**: A performant, modular cloth simulation system that can be used for in-game capes, flags, or environmental detail.
- **Why**: To explore physics systems, optimization, and shader interaction in a custom implementation â€” and deepen my technical skill set in Unity.

## âœ… Current Progress

- [x] Basic particle system for cloth points (mass + velocity)
- [x] Structural spring constraints between particles
- [x] Gravity and wind force integration
- [x] Simple anchor support (e.g. pinning corners)
- [ ] Self-collision / object collision
- [ ] GPU optimization / compute shader pass (planned)

> ðŸ‘€ Visuals coming soon: working on GIFs and screenshots as I refine the look and feel

## ðŸ§  Challenges & Learnings

- Implementing constraint resolution without jitter
- Balancing stiffness vs. simulation speed (frame rate impact)
- Visual clarity: debugging invisible forces via gizmos and draw lines

---

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- Add support for mesh skinning (connect simulation to visual mesh)
- Integrate with Unity colliders for environment interaction
- Polish visual output for portfolio presentation
- Optional: Explore GPU-based simulation with compute shaders for large-scale cloth

## ðŸ“Ž Related Skills Demonstrated

- C# physics implementation
- Unity custom systems (non-MonoBehaviour)
- Real-time simulation debugging and performance tuning
